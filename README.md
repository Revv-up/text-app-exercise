# App Exercise (Full-Stack)
## Overview
This is a coding exercise for candidates applying for a full-stack (frontend leaning) developer position at RevvUp. It currently focuses on "Frontend", which together include a series of tasks involving HTML, CSS, Javascript.

To start, simply clone this repo and make edits locally.


## Frontend
Our frontend is written in React and ... which contains some boilerplate HTML with 6 div elements. There are 3 features we'd like to add:

1. Add 
2. Something
3. Else

feel free to use third-party libraries at your own discretion.

## Backend
For the backend, we have an empty javascript. We'd like to write some code that achieves the following:

1. Make an authenticated request to the dev store's Admin APi
2. Retrieve all product data and calculate the sum of all available inventory for all products
